SUMO Toolbox Changelog
-----------------------

Also see the release notes on http://www.sumowiki.intec.ugent.be

* 7.0 - Released 29 Jan 2009
	+ Move to a open source licence (AGPL), see http://www.sumowiki.intec.ugent.be/index.php/License_terms
	+ Experimental support for classification and 3D geometric modeling  problems (see the 2 new demos)
	+ Thorough cleanup of SampleEvaluator related classes and package structure
	+ Improved speed and stability in (Blind) Kriging models and fixed the correlation function derivatives.
	+ Vastly improved the utilization of compute nodes if a distributed sample evaluator is used that interfaces with a cluster or grid
	+ Support for plotting the prediction uncertainty in the model browser GUI 
	+ Support for quasi random sequences as initial design

* 6.2.1 - Released 19 Oct 2009
        + Various bugfixes

* 6.2 - Released 6 Oct 2009 
	+ A new neural network modelbuilder "ann".  This is a lot faster than the existing "anngenetic" and the quality of the models is roughly the same
	+ The sample selection infrastructure is now much more powerful, sample selection criteria can be combined with much more flexibility.
	  This opens the way to dynamic variation of sampling criteria.
	+ Support for Input constraints / multiple output sampling in the LOLA-Voronoi sample selection algorithm
	+ Support for auto-sampled inputs (e.g., frequency in an EM context) in LOLA-Voronoi.  This is useful if a particular input is already sampled by your simulator.
	+ Automatic filtering of samples close to each other in CombinedSampleSelector
	+ Support for TriScatteredInterp in InterpolationModel when it is available (Matlab version 2009a and later)
	+ Sample selectors that support it (for example: LOLA-Voronoi) now give priorities to new samples, to that samples are
	  submitted and evaluated in order of importance.
	+ Support for pre-calculated Latin Hypercube Designs, these will be automatically downloaded and used where possible and will improve performance
	+ The Blind Kriging models have been improved and can now also be used as ordinary Kriging models.  Since these models
	  are superior to the existing DACE Toolbox models, the DACE Toolbox backend has been removed.
	+ The EGOModelBuilder (do model parameter optimization using the EGO algorithm) now uses a nested blind kriging model
	  instead of one based on the DACE Toolbox.  This allows for better accuracy
	+ The Kriging correlation functions can now be chosen automatically (instead of only the correlation parameters)
	+ Support for multiobjective optimization in the EGO framewok (extended version of probability of improvement)
	+ DelaunaySampleSelector, OptimizeCriterion support the same set of criterions
	+ EGO Improvement criteria can now be used together with DACEModel, RBFModel, and SVMModel (LS-SVM backend only)
	+ Added a model type and builder that does linear/cubic/nearest neighbour interpolation
	+ All error functions and measures now consistently deal with complex valued data and multiple output models
	+ Various improvements in the Model Info GUI as part of the Model browser tool
	+ Improved stability in LRMMeasure, a behavioral complexity metric to help ensure parsimonious models
	+ The profiler GUI has been updated and improved, and support for textual profilers has been added.
	+ Improved performance when using Measures, especially for models with multiple outputs.
	+ Improved management of the best model trace, also in pareto mode
	+ Removed the debug output when using (LS-)SVM models and added compiled mex files for Windows
	+ Ported the remaining classes to Matlabs Classdef format
	+ Increased use of the parallel computing toolbox (if available) in order to speed up modeling
	+ Improved the Matlab file headers so the help text is more informative (always includes at least the signature)
	+ Support for plotting the model prediction uncertainty in the model browser (only for 1D plots and not supported by all model types)
	+ Added support for so-called "reference by id" on every level of the config. If a tag of a particular type is defined on top-level with an id,
	  it can be referenced everywhere else, instead of copying it entirely. See rationalPoleSupression sample selector and patternsearch Optimizer, for example.
	+ EmptyModelBuilder added - in case you just want to use the sequential design facilities of the toolbox, but not its models.
	+ Various cleanups and bugfixes

* 6.1.1 - Released 17 Apr 2009
	+ Various cleanups and bugfixes (see known bugs for 6.1)

* 6.1 - Released 16 Feb 2009
	+ The default error function is now the Bayesian Error Estimation Quotient (BEEQ)
	+ Full support for multi-objective model generation, multiple measures can now be enforced simultaneously.  This 
	  can also be applied to generating models with multiple outputs (combineOutputs = true).  Together with the
	  automatic model type selection algorithm (heterogenetic) this allows the automatic selection of the best model
	  type per output.
	+ The model browser GUI now supports QQ plots
	+ The Gradient Sample Selection Algorithm has been renamed to the Local Linear Sample Selector (LOLASampleSelector)
	+ The modelbuilders have been refactored and some removed.  This is a result of the optimizer hierarchy being
	  cleaned up.  Adding a new model parameter optimization routine should now be more straightforward.
	+ The interface classes have been renamed to factories as this is more correct.  All implementations have been 
	  ported to Matlab's new Classdef format and the inherritance hierarchy has been cleaned up.  It should now
	  be significantly easier to add support for new approximation types.
	+ The ModelInterfaces are now known as ModelFactories, this is more correct.  Note that the XML tagnames have 
	  been changed as well.
	+ The Model class hierarchy has been converted to the new Classdef format.  This means that models generated  
	  with previous versions of the toolbox will no longer be loadable in this version.
	+ The heterogenetic model builder for automatic model type selection has been cleaned up and made more robust.
	+ Rational models now support all available modelbuilders.  This means that order selection can be done by PSO
	  DIRECT, Simulated Annealing, ... instead of just GA and Sequential.
	+ New optimizers added are (they can also be used as model builders): Differential Evolution
	+ Added a Blind Kriging model type implementation as a backend of KrigingModel
	+ Addition of an EGO model builder.  This allows optimization of the model parameters using the well known 
	  Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm.  In essence this uses a nested Kriging Model to predict which 
	  parameters should be used to build the next model.
	+ Trivial dependencies on the Statistics Toolbox have been removed
	+ Added a new smoothness measure (LRMMeasure) that helps to ensure smooth models and reduce erratic bumps.  It 
	  works best when combined with other Measures (such as SampleError for ANN models) 
	+ Models now have a simple evaluateDerivative() method that allows one to easily get gradient information.  The 
	  base class implementation is very simple but works. Models can override this method to get more efficient 
	  implementations.
	+ Added experimental support for the Matlab Parallel Computing Toolbox (local scheduler only).  
	  This means that when the parallelMode option in ContextConfig is switched on, model construction will make
	  use of all available cores/cpu's.
	+ Many speed improvements, some quite significant.
	+ Various cleanups and bugfixes

* 6.0.1 - Released 23 August 2008
	+ Various bug fixes to the 6.0 release

* 6.0 - Released 06 August 2008
	+ Many important bugs have been fixed that could have resulted in sub-optimal models
	+ Addition of a Model Browser GUI, this allows you to easily 'walk' through multi-dimensional models
	+ Moved the InitialDesign tag outside of the SUMO tag
	+ Some speed improvements
	+ Removed support for dummy inputs
	+ Measure scores and input/output names are saved inside the models, allowing for more usable plots
	+ Added the project directory concept, each example is now self contained in its own directory
	+ #simulatorname# can now be used in the run name, it will get replaced	by the real simulator name
	+ Input dimensions can be ignored during sampling if the simulator samples them for you.
	  This is useful in EM applications for example where frequency points can be cheap.
	+ Logging framework revamped, logs can now be saved on a per run basis
	+ The global score calculation has changed! it is a weighted sum of all
	individual measures. (the weights are configurable but default to 1)
	+ Added a simple polynomial model where the orders can be chosen manually
	+ Countless cleanups, minor bugfixes and feature enhancements

		+ pluggable input queue infrastructure to make advanced scheduling policies possible
	+ The number of samples to select each iteration is now selected dynamically, based
	  on the time needed for modeling, the length of one simulation, the number of compute nodes
	  available, ...
	  A user specified upper bound can till be specified of course.
	+ Model plots are now in the original space instead of the normalized ([-1 1]) space
	+ The default error function is now the root relative square error (= a global relative error)

	+ Added a Neural Network Modeler based on NNSYSID 
	  (http://www.iau.dtu.dk/research/control/nnsysid.html)
	+ The LS-SVM model type has been merged with the SVM model type.  The SVM model now supports three
	  backends: libSVM, SVMlight, and lssvm
	+ Added a SampleSelector using infill sampling criterions (ISC).
		+ The expected improvement from EGO/superEGO is provided among others.
		(only usable with Kriging and RBF)
	+ More robust handling of SSH sessions when running simulators on a remote cluster
	+ The TestSamples measure has been renamed to ValidationSet
	+ The Polynomial model type has been renamed to the more apt Rational model
	+ The grid and voronoi sample selectors have been renamed to Error and Density respectively

	+ Movie creation now works on all supported platforms
	+ Added an optimizer class hierarchy for solving subproblems transparantly
	+ Cleaned up the structure of all the model classes so they no longer contain an interface
	  object.  This was confusing and led to error prone code.  All subsref and subassgn implementations
	  have also been removed.
	+ The MinMax measure is now enabled by default
	+ The Optimization framework was removed (and replaced) for various reasons, see:
		http://sumowiki.intec.ugent.be/index.php/FAQ#What_about_surrogate_driven_optimization.3F
